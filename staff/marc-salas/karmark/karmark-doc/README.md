# Karmark

for this project I used a Wemos D1 mini board and two servomotors

To program this board I use Arduino IDE that is based on C and C++. It is used to program Arduino boards but there are also other boards that are compatible with that software.

Here you cand downloa for free

Anyway we will need to change some configurations to be able to sende the program to the Wemos.

We need to go to Boards Manager and find our board. The Wemos D1 mini is a ESP8266 based board, so we can select this one and install.
